Kids Seating

Today the kindergarten has a new group of n kids who need to be seated at the dinner table. The chairs at the table are numbered from 1 to 4n. Two kids can't sit on the same chair. It is known that two kids who sit on chairs with numbers a and b (aâ‰ b) will indulge if:
gcd(a,b)=1 or,
a divides b or b divides a.
The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the kids so there are no 2 of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no pair of chairs a and b that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above.
