/*
Reverse Binary Strings
You are given a string s of even length n. String s is binary, in other words, consists only of 0's and 1's.

String s has exactly n2 zeroes and n2 ones (n is even).

In one operation you can reverse any substring of s . A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.

What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string s alternating? A string is alternating if siâ‰ si+1 for all i. There are two types of alternating strings in general: 01010101... or 10101010...
